        Last Tuesday Lisa "flew" from London to Madrid. She "got" 
        up at 6 o'clock  in the morning and "had" a cup of coffee. At 6.30 
        she "left" home and "drove" to the airport. When she "got" there, she "parked"
        the car, "walked" to the airport building, and "checked" in. Then she "had"
        breakfast at a cafe and "waited" for her flight. The plane "departed" on time and
        "arrived" in Madrid two hours later. Finally she "took" a taxi from the  airport to her
        hotel in the centre of Madrid.
